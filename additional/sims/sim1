This sim creates a slowly moving sun, then starts two streams of objects
moving in opposite directions around the sun. The streams migrate as their
orbits follow the sun.

Assumes that you're at a directory with the server jar at: ./server/target/server.jar and the client
is at ./client/target/client.jar.

First, start an empty sim:
java -jar server/target/server.jar --sim-name=empty &

Press F12 to disengage the mouse and keyboard from the sim window. Then tab back to the console and
paste these three commands in:

java -jar client/target/client.jar add-bodies 0 0 0 -191547200 0 0 52E30 53 is-sun collision=subsume &
java -jar client/target/client.jar add-bodies 400  400 -400 -850000000  923000000 -350000000 9E5 5 color=red    qty=600 delay=.3 &
java -jar client/target/client.jar add-bodies 400 -400  400 -850000000 -923000000 -350000000 9E5 3 color=yellow qty=600 delay=.3 &

Click the sim window and press F12 to re-attach the mouse and keyboard to the sim window. Use the navigation
keys to navigate through the sim.
