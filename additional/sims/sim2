This sim creates a stationary sun, then creates four clusters of bodies - each
cluster orbiting the sun. Each of the clusters has enough gravity such that they
aggregate loosely as a cluster while they orbit the sun. So each cluster exhibits some
characteristics of a single body even though they are loose collections of individual
bodies. The clusters interact with each other and the sun as they orbit.

Assumes that you're at a directory with the server jar at: ./server/target/server.jar and the client
is at ./client/target/client.jar.

First, start an empty sim:
java -jar server/target/server.jar --sim-name=empty --initial-cam=-100,300,3200 &

Press F12 to disengage the mouse and keyboard from the sim window. Then tab back to the console and
paste this command in to create a sun:

java -jar client/target/client.jar add-body 0 0 0 0 0 0 52E30 153 is-sun collision=subsume pinned

Then, paste these in as a group:

java -jar client/target/client.jar add-bodies 400 400 400 -230000000  2143000000 -1150000000 9E26 4 color=RED qty=400 posrand=50
sleep 20
java -jar client/target/client.jar add-bodies 400 400 400 -230000000  2143000000 -1150000000 9E26 4 color=GREEN qty=400 posrand=50
sleep 20
java -jar client/target/client.jar add-bodies 400 400 400 -230000000  2143000000 -1150000000 9E26 4 color=LIGHTGRAY qty=400 posrand=50
sleep 20
java -jar client/target/client.jar add-bodies 400 400 400 -230000000  2143000000 -1150000000 9E26 4 color=YELLOW qty=400 posrand=50

Click the sim window and press F12 to re-attach the mouse and keyboard to the sim window. Use the navigation
keys to navigate through the sim.
