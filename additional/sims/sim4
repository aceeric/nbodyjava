This sim creates small low-gravity sun far removed from 0,0,0 just to create a light
source. It then creates two bodies moving directly towards each other. One body is configured
to fragment on impact and the other is not. The bodies impact, and one fragments.

Assumes that you're at a directory with the server jar at: ./server/target/server.jar and the client
is at ./client/target/client.jar.

First, start an empty sim:
java -jar server/target/server.jar --sim-name=empty &

Press F12 to disengage the mouse and keyboard from the sim window. Then tab back to the console and
paste these commands in:

java -jar client/target/client.jar add-body 100000 100000 100000 0 0 0 1 500 is-sun pinned collision=subsume
java -jar client/target/client.jar add-body  600 0 -600 -550000000 0 550000000 9E12 30 color=yellow \
 collision=fragment frag-factor=.5 frag-step=400 &
java -jar client/target/client.jar add-body -600 0  600  550000000 0 -550000000 9E27 10 color=red &

Click the sim window and press F12 to re-attach the mouse and keyboard to the sim window. Use the navigation
keys to navigate through the sim.
